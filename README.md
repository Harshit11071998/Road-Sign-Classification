# Road-Sign-Classification

Classification of Road Sign using CNN. The Dataset used is  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign">here</a> . 

To train your model in your own dataset use traffic2.py. You can also use mine trained model named 'model_trained.p', if you dont want to train your own model.

Use traffic2_test_data.py file to test the model accurase on test dataset 

You can also use it in real time using web cam or by using an image, use file traffic_test.py file.

I have used Keras to build and train my model. And the Accuracy that I achieved is around 97%.
